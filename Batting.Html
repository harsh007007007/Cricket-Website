<h1>General Batting information</h1>

<section>

<p>Over time a standard batting technique has been developed which is used by most batting players. Technique refers to the batting player's stance before the ball is bowled as well as the movement of the hands, feet, head, and body in the execution of a cricket stroke. Good technique is characterized by quickly getting into the correct position to play the shot, especially getting one's head and body in line with the ball, one's feet placed next to where the ball would bounce and then swinging the bat at the ball to make contact at the precise moment required for the particular stroke being played.</p>

<p>The movement of the batting player for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batting player, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be referred to as vertical or straight-bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).</P>

<p>While a batting player is not limited in where or how they may hit the ball, the development of good technique has gone hand in hand with the development of a standard or orthodox cricket shots played to specific types of deliveries. These "textbook" shots are standard material found in many coaching manuals.</p>

<p>The advent of limited overs cricket, with its emphasis on rapid run-scoring, has led to increasing use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders. Unorthodox shots are typically – but not always – more high-risk than orthodox shots due to some aspects of good batting technique being abandoned.</p>

</figure>

<p>The stance is the position in which a batting player stands to have the ball bowled to them. An ideal stance is "comfortable, relaxed and balanced",[citation needed] with the feet 40 centimetres (16 in) apart, parallel and astride the crease. Additionally, the front shoulder should be pointing down the wicket, the head facing the bowler, the weight equally balanced and the bat near the back toe.[3] A slight crouch is adopted in order to be in a more effective striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles; this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically. As the ball is about to be released, the batter will lift their bat up behind in anticipation of playing a stroke and will shift their weight onto the balls of their feet. By doing this they are ready to move swiftly into position to address the ball once they see its path out of the bowler's hand.</p>

<p>Although the textbook, side-on stance is the most common, a few international players, such as Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Smith, use an "open" or "square on" stance.</p>

<br><h2 id="2">Backlift</h2>

<figcaption><em>Backlift Example</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Backlift is how a batting player lifts their bat in preparation for hitting the ball.[4] While the bat should be raised as vertically as possible, coaching manuals often suggest that correct technique is for the bat to be slightly angled from the perpendicular; a common instruction is to point the face of the bat in the direction of first or second slip.[4] Some players (notably, in recent times, Brian Lara, Virender Sehwag)[5][failed verification] have employed an exaggerated backlift. Others, who have employed the more unorthodox open stance, such as Peter Willey, had a more abbreviated backlift.</p>

<figcaption><em>Example of backfoot and frontfoot shot making</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Depending upon the path of the ball, the batting player will either move forward or back in their attempt to intercept it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backward movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batting player will step forward towards the ball, bending their front knee to bring the bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forward, the batting player is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batting player will step back and, if necessary, stand on their tiptoes to raise the bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, they also receive the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.</p>
