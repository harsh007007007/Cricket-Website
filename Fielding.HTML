<h2>Fielding position names and locations</h2>

<p>There are 11 players in a team: one is the bowler and another is the wicket-keeper, so only nine other fielding positions can be occupied at any time. Where fielders are positioned is a tactical decision made by the captain of the fielding team. The captain (usually in consultation with the bowler and sometimes other members of the team) may move players between fielding positions at any time except when a bowler is in the act of bowling to a batsman.</p>

<p>There are a number of named basic fielding positions, some of which are employed very commonly and others that are used less often. However, these positions are neither fixed nor precisely defined, and fielders can be placed in positions that differ from the basic positions. The nomenclature of the positions is somewhat esoteric, but roughly follows a system of polar coordinates – one word (leg, cover, mid-wicket) specifies the angle from the batsman, and is sometimes preceded by an adjective describing the distance from the batsman (silly, short, deep or long). Words such as "backward", "forward", or "square" can further indicate the angle.</p>

<p>The image shows the location of most of the named fielding positions based on a right-handed batsman. The area to the left of a right-handed batsman (from the batsman's point of view – facing the bowler) is called the leg side or on side, while that to the right is the off side. If the batsman is left-handed, the leg and off sides are reversed and the fielding positions are a mirror image of those shown.</p>

<p>Some fielding positions are used offensively. That is, players are put there with the main aim being to catch out the batsman rather than to stop or slow down the scoring of runs. These positions include Slip (often there are multiple slips next to each other, designated First slip, Second slip, Third slip, etc., numbered outwards from the wicket-keeper – collectively known as the slip cordon) meant to catch balls that just edge off the bat; Gully; Fly slip; Leg slip; Leg gully; the short and silly positions. Short leg, also known as bat pad, is a position specifically intended to catch balls that unintentionally strike the bat and leg pad, and thus end up only a metre or two to the leg side.</p>

<strong>Common fielding names:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Saving one or On the single - As close as the fielder needs to be to prevent the batsmen from running a quick single, normally about 15–20 yards from the wicket.</li>
<li>Saving two - As close as the fielder needs to be to prevent the batsmen from running two runs, normally about 50–60 yards (46–55 m) from the wicket.</li>
<li>Right on - right on the boundary.</li>
<li>Deep, long - Farther away from the batsman.</li>
<li>Short - Closer to the batsman.</li>
<li>Silly - Very close to the batsman, so-called because of the perceived danger of doing so.</li>
<li>Square - Somewhere along an imaginary extension of the popping crease.</li>
<li>Fine - Closer to an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps, when describing a fielder behind square.</li>
<li>Straight - Closer to an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps, when describing a fielder in front of square.</li>
<li>Wide - Further from an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps.</li>
<li>Forward - In front of square; further towards the end occupied by the bowler and further away from the end occupied by the batsman on strike.</li>
<li>Backward - Behind square; further towards the end occupied by the batsman on strike and further away from the end occupied by the bowler.</li>
</ul>
